# Initial commit: Basic voice assistant with speech recognition and music playback
Set up initial structure for the voice assistant project:
- Integrated speech recognition using Google API
- Added text-to-speech with pyttsx3
- Implemented wake-word detection ("Jarvis")
- Added support for basic browser commands (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Created a modular music library with support for song playback via YouTube/Spotify
- Included error handling and debug output for command flow

Next steps: expand command set, improve UI, and add fallback search for unknown songs.
